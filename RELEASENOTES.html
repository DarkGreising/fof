<h3>This version of FOF is developed outside Joomla!</h3>
<p>
    This package contains a copy of FOF 2.x with its class prefixes renamed from <code>FOF</code> to <code>F0F</code>
    (F-zero-F). Moreover, the installation path changed from
    <code>JPATH_LIBRARIES . '/fof'</code> to <code>JPATH_LIBRARIES . '/f0f'</code> (again: that's f-zero-f). The same
    goes for the <code>FOF_INCLUDED</code> constant which is now called <code>F0F_INCLUDED</code> (again: that's
    f-zero-f). If you want to use this version please remember to change these instances from <code>FOF</code> to
    <code>F0F</code>.
